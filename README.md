I'm looking to become a webdeveloper and want to build an online portfolio here to showcase to prospective employers.
I'm 40, Dutch and a dad. Back in the late eighties my father first brought home a PC. Back then I was working the DOS prompt to create starting menus with BATCH files or toying with QBasic. During jobs later I sort of rolled into spreadsheets and coded and macro'd in those a lot. Created a automated character sheet for D&D3e.
Now I'm learing html, css, js and php as quickly as I can, so I can get working on a job and learn more as I do that. Of course I'm also interested in Python or any other languages important to webdevelopment. Unity looks cool also, but is probably for the future.
My current project is a website for my own 'company', that provides clowning workshops for adults or kids. That's right: clowns. I love clowns. Deal with it.
