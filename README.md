I'm looking to become a webdeveloper and want to build an online portfolio here to showcase to prospective employers.
I'm 40, Dutch and a dad. Back in the late eighties my father first brought home a PC. Back then I was working the DOS prompt to create starting menus with BATCH files or toying with QBasic. During jobs later I sort of rolled into spreadsheets and coded and macro'd in those a lot.
Now I'm learing html, css, js and java as quickly as I can, so I can get working on a job and learn more as I do that. Of course I'm also interested in Python or any other languages.
